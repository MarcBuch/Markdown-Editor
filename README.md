# Yet Another Markdown Editor

I use this projec to explore editor packages in the NPM ecosystem. Maybe someday I build the perfect note taking tool...

## Run

```Shell
# Install deps
$ npm install

# Run local environment
$ npm run dev

# Run production build/deployment
$ npm run start
```

If you have access to a railway account:

```Shell
# Run locally
$ railway run yarn dev

# Deploy to prod
$ railway up
```
